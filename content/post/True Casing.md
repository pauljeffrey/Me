# Title: Unraveling the Secrets of Raw Text: A Journey Through Word, Sentence Segmentation and Capitalization with Python (Part 3)

## Introduction

The final piece of the puzzle is to capitalize the first letter of each sentence and other words that need to be cased (e.g nouns). This not only enhances readability but also provides valuable contextual information.
By the way, if you have not checked out the first 2 parts of this lovely project's article, you can find it <a href="/projects/Word Segmentation.md"> here </a>. I advice that you follow the previous parts of this project first before reading this last one.

To achieve this, We are going to train a model using the following principles/assumptions of true casing of words:

- The first letter of the first word after a '.','!','?' (beginning of a sentence) is always capitalized.
- Names and other proper nouns should be capitalized.
- Words after a colon should not be capitalized.
- Capitalize the first word of a quote.
- Capitalize months , days but not seasons.

Therefore, we create functions to extract some of these information for our model. To save time, I will leave them here but please take your time to go through each of them to understand what they do.


```python
months = ['january', 'february','march','april','may','june','july','august','september','october','november','december']
days = ['monday','tuesday', 'wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday','sunday']

# These punctuations separate sentences in english language.
sent_separator = ['.','!','?','UNK']
# function checks if a word begins a sentence.
def begins_sentence(row):
  if row['pre-1 words'] in sent_separator:
    return True
  else:
    return False

# if the word is a month or day
def is_month_day(word):
  if ( word in months ) or (word in days):
    return True
  else:
    return False

# If the word is a proper noun
def is_proper_noun(word):
  if word == 'NNP' or word == 'NP':
    return True
  else:
    return False

# if the word comes after quotes
def supersede_quote(row):
  if row['pre-1 words'] == "'" or row['pre-1 words'] == '"':
    return True
  else:
    return False

# if the word comes after a colon
def after_colon(row):
  if row['pre-1 words'] == ':':
    return True

  else:
    return False

# function to check if word is a symbol or digit:
def check_digit_sym(word):
  if (word in punctuations) or (word in symbols) :
    return True
  elif word.isdigit():
    return True
  else:
    False

```
Now, we extract and process the train and test data

```python
corpus = ext_tagged_corpus(8) # extract corpus

words, tags, target_data = create_sent_data(corpus, casing=True)
del corpus
```

```python
sent_df = pd.DataFrame({'words': words, 'tags': tags}) # create dataframe
sent_df.head()
```
<img src="/static/images/Text segmentation/part3/Table 1.png" alt="Table 1">

Some functions from the word segmentation model were used here also.

```python
def process_case_data(df,n_gram=1,fill_value = 'WRB+DOZ'):

  # Extract all features as described earlier
  df['is_month_day'] = df['words'].apply(is_month_day)
  #df['is_digit_sym']  = df['words'].apply(check_digit_sym)
  df['is_proper_noun']  = df['tags'].apply(is_proper_noun)



  # block of code extract context and its features (words around index word)
  df = extract_context(df, 'words','words', n_gram=n_gram,fill_value=fill_value)
  df = extract_context(df, 'tags','tags', n_gram=n_gram,fill_value=fill_value)

  # Extract all features as described earlier
  df['after_colon'] = df.apply(after_colon,1)
  df['supersed_quote'] = df.apply(supersede_quote,1)
  df['begins_sentence'] = df.apply(begins_sentence,1)

  # Drop all irrelevant columns
  drop = ['post-1 words']
  drop.append('pre-1 words')
  drop.append('post-1 tags') # we remove the tags that come after word and leave the one that comes before.

  drop.append('words')

  df = drop_column(df, drop)

  return df

train = process_case_data(sent_df)
train.head()
```
<img src="/static/images/Text segmentation/part3/Table 1.png" alt="Table 1">

```python
# Also save tags for this model
case_tag_list = train['tags']
save_to_file(case_tag_list, os.path.join(FILE_PATH,'case_tag_list'))
```

Since all columns are categorical , we pass it through an ordinal and one hot encoder first we append 'UNK' to the tags column for general representaton of tags.

```python

case_cat_value = [list(train[col].unique()) for col in train.columns]
case_cat_value[0].append('UNK')

for col in case_cat_value:
  try:
    col.sort()
  except:
    continue


# preprocess data by passing through encoder transformer

case_pipeline = Pipeline([('ordinal_encoder', OrdinalEncoder()),
                          ('one hot', OneHotEncoder())])
# Fit transformer to data.
train = case_pipeline.fit_transform(train)

# Save transformer to file
transformer_path = os.path.join(FILE_PATH,'case_pipeline')
save_to_file(case_pipeline,transformer_path)
```
Split data into train and test

```python
# Convert target_data variables from string format to numerical format
target_data = to_cat(target_data, case_cat_targ)

# change target to categorical format (One hot encoding)
target_data = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(target_data)

# Split data into train and test set
X_train, X_test , y_train, y_test  = train_test_split(train, target_data, test_size= 0.15,
                                                      random_state=42,shuffle=False)

X_train
```

```
<619288x890 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
	with 4335016 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
```

Again, we create our model with the previous function <a href="">Part 1</a>

```python
# Get input and output dim
input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
output_dim = 2 # because we have only 2 targets

model = create_model(input_dim, 1500, 1000, output_dim)
model.summary()
```

```

Now, we train the model

```python
# Schedule early stopping so that model can be stopped when there is no longer improvement
# after at least 5 steps.
epochs = 20
es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', mode='min', verbose=1, patience=3)

# Schedule learning rate when you hit a plateau
lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.1, patience=3, min_delta=1E-7)

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size,
                    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),callbacks=[es,lr])
```

```

```

Let's print the training history:
```python
pyplot.plot(history.history['loss'], label='train')
pyplot.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='test')
pyplot.legend()
pyplot.show()
```

<img src="/images/Text segmentation/casing.png" alt="Table 1">

We save this model like this and calculate our metrics

```python
model_name = 'Casing_model'
model_path = os.path.join(FILE_PATH,model_name)

model.save(model_path)
```

Let's evaluate our model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, precision_score , recall_score, accuracy_score
# Error Functions and evaluation

# Use this functions to perform f1_score, recall and precision for error analysis.
def calculate_metrics(cat_target , y_true, y_pred):
  # For each label classification , we create a case of 'has label' and 'has no label'.
  # For example, for the 'I' label, we convert all predictions into 1 for 'I' and 0 for not 'I'
  try:
    y_true = list(np.argmax(y_true, 1))
  except:
    print('True predictions must be in categorical format.')
    return

  y_pred = list(np.argmax(y_pred,1))

## Tying It All Together
We are going to combine the predictive power of all the models and their processing pipelines into one function. We define all the functions needed for this in the code snippet below:

  result = []

```

Lets test it all at once. We have our models saved to file.
We will use the first genre of the brown corpus for this. We will extract the text and remove all space, comma, full stop characters and casing from the text. Then we will run it through the <code>process_raw_text</code> function to intuitively analyze the performance of the models combined.

```python
corpus = brown.words(categories=brown.categories()[0])

text = ''
for word in corpus:
  text += word.lower()
text = text.replace('.','')
text = text.replace(',','')
text
```

This is what the raw text looks like when all the above are removed.
```

Now, let's run this text chunk through our series of models to process and reformat the text.

```python
# We will be using 'WRB+DOZ' as our fill_na values throughout.
process_raw_text(text, least_tag)
```
```

```
We can see that our model did a really good job with processing this text here! Just amazing!!

## Conclusion

The culmination of these efforts resulted in a highly accurate system for processing unstructured raw text. With an accuracy of approximately 97%, this system can effectively segment words and sentences, as well as capitalize words correctly.
